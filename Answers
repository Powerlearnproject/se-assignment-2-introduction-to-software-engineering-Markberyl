Software engineering is the process of designing,deelopind, testing and maintaing of a software.

The traditional programming mainly focuses on writing codes to solve a specific problem while software programming involver broader approach to software development.In Programming software engineering focuses on the entire cycle of software deelopment the planning, designing,coding, testing, deployment and maintenance while the traditonal focuses on individual algorithims and components.The approach traditional focuses on solving immediate problems while the engineering follows specific methodology.In testins the engineering undergoes rigorous testing while the traditional one undergoes informal and limited to unit tests.the documentation in tradtional is minimal and requires a small group to do it while the engineering one requires comprehensie documentation and a large group to compile its project
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process that involves several phases, each with specific tasks and objectives. These phases include planning, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

The SDLC is divided into four phases: planning, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Planning involves defining the project scope, objectives, resources, timelines, and risks, while requirements analysis gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements. Design focuses on developing the overall architecture and detailed design of the software, while implementation involves writing the actual code according to design specifications. Testing ensures the software meets requirements and is free of defects, while deployment releases the software to end-users. Maintenance involves continuously improving and updating the software.

Agile and Waterfall. The Waterfall model follows a linear and sequential approach, with fixed requirements and clear milestones. It is simple to understand and manage but has high risk of encountering issues late in the project. On the other hand, the Agile model is iterative and incremental, developing the software in small, manageable units called iterations or sprints. It is highly flexible and adaptable to changes, promotes frequent delivery of functional software, and encourages stakeholder involvement throughout the project.Agile is usually preffered because of its flexibility and is suitable for larger, complex, and evolving projects.

Requirements engineering is a crucial process in software development that involves defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements of a software system to ensure it meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders. The process includes identifying, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing software requirements. It involves a series of stages, including elicitation, analysis, specification, validation, and management.

The elicitation stage involves gathering requirements from stakeholders through various methods, such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and use case analysis. The analysis stage involves understanding and refining the requirements, prioritizing them, and resolving conflicts. The specification stage involves creating a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document that is understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. The validation stage involves reviewing and validating the requirements with stakeholders through reviews, walkthroughs, inspections, and testing.
The importance of requirements engineering lies in its ability to align with stakeholder needs, reduce risk, improve communication, serve as a basis for design and development, and help manage project scope.

Software design principles are guidelines that help developers create efficient, maintainable, scalable, and robust software systems. Key principles include modularity, separation of concerns, abstraction, encapsulation, coupling and cohesion, DRY, KISS, and YAGNI. Modularity enhances maintainability, understandability, and reusability by decomposing the system into smaller, manageable modules. Separation of concerns simplifies development and maintenance by allowing developers to focus on one aspect at a time. Abstraction hides complex implementation details, encapsulation protects the internal state of an object, and minimizes coupling and cohesion. DRY avoids duplication of code by abstracting common functionality, KISS keeps the design simple, and YAGNI prevents over-engineering by focusing development efforts on essential features. 

**Modularity**:

Breaking down software into smaller, self-contained units (modules).Each module has a specific function and interacts with others via defined interfaces

**How Modularity Improves Maintainability**

Isolation of Changes.Changes in one module donâ€™t affect others.
Easier Debugging and Testing Smaller modules are simpler to test and debug.
Simplified Understanding.Developers can focus on individual modules.
Version Control.Modules can be versioned separately.
Reduced Risk.Containment of changes prevents widespread issues.

**Modularity Improves Scalability**
Parallel Development.Multiple teams can work on different modules simultaneously.Incremental Updates.Features or updates can be added without overhauling the entire system.
Performance Optimization.Optimize individual modules independently.
Resource Allocation.Deploy modules on different servers/resources.
Flexibility. Esily extend the system by adding new modules.

E-commerce application with modules:
- User Management
- Product Catalog
- Order Processing
- Inventory Management
- notification Service

Each module can be independently developed, tested, and maintained.

Modularity enhances maintainability and scalability by:
- Simplifying development and testing
- Supporting parallel and incremental development
- Allowing for performance optimization and resource allocation
- Facilitating system extensions and flexibility

Software testing is a  process in software development, ensuring the quality, functionality, performance, and security of software. It involves various levels of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Unit testing verifies that individual components or functions work correctly, while integration testing ensures that different modules or services work together as expected. System testing validates the complete and integrated software system against specified requirements, using tools like Selenium, QTP, and LoadRunner. Acceptance testing confirms the software meets business requirements and is ready for delivery, using tools like Cucumber and TestRail. Testing is essential for identifying bugs early, enhancing security, improving performance, validating functionality, building confidence, facilitating maintenance, and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements. By conducting these levels of testing, developers and testers can identify and fix issues early, improve user satisfaction, and deliver reliable and efficient software products.

Tools to manage changes to source code over time, allowing collaboration, tracking, and version management.

Software maintenance is a crucial phase in the software lifecycle, involving corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive activities to ensure software longevity, security, performance, and adaptability. It involves fixing bugs, improving performance, and adapting the software to a changed environment. There are four types of maintenance activities: corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive. Corrective maintenance involves fixing bugs and errors discovered after deployment, while adaptive maintenance modifies the software to work in new environments. Perfective maintenance improves the software by adding new features or optimizing performance. Preventive maintenance aims to prevent future issues by improving the software's maintainability and reliability. The importance of software maintenance in the software lifecycle is evident in its ability to extend software life, maintain user satisfaction, ensure security, improve performance, adapt to new environments, reduce costs, and maintain compliance with standards and regulations.
